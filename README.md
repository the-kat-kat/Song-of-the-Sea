An underwater game where you can enjoy the flow of the ocean
Echolocation mechanics and more intensive gameplay coming soon!

Engine: Godot

I struggled a lot with build errors at first (for some reason I can never get audio playlists to work!) as well as collision shapes that flip when the player switches direction (sometime things get stuck in the player's collision shape). However, a lot of testing small changes and debugging messages helped me identify where the errors came from!

This game is being developed for Shiba :D In the end, I plan for it to be centered around echolocation, where you have to use a sound mechanic to navigate (I haven't started making this yet TT)
